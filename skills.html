 <p> Need your lawn mowed? No problem! They love to eat grass and can trim it to perfection. They are perfect diggers which is 
   ideal for planting any type of plant and with their rearanging skills they can drag the plant into place and fill the hole back
   up. </p>
 <p> When it gets too hot they like to take a break: <img src="outside_300jpg.jpg" alt="Nova and Luna Taking a Break" width="300" height="400"> </p>
 <p> They are super easy going for payment. All they want are some tasty treats such as carrots, bananas,
    strawberries or kale or suprise them with something else, they even enjoy just cardboard boxes.</p>
