<p> Meet Nova <img src="Nova2_300.jpg" alt="Nova" width="300" height="400"> and Luna<img src="lunaa.jpg" alt="Luna" width="300" height="287">.
 Luna is Nova's mom and they are best friends <img src="Besties_300.jpg" alt="Nova and Luna" width="300" height="400">.
  They are always hungry and so they are looking for work. </p> 
  
<p> They are restless, love to keep busy and happen to be avid gardeners. That being said, if you want to make sure they stay on task, their best friend 'Moxie', who is a cat,
  can help make sure that happens. She likes to lie down and watch tv <img src="moxiee.jpg" alt="Moxie With the Remote" width="300" height="277">, but once outside, 
  she is very attentive <img src="Moxie_300.jpg" alt="Moxie Outside" width="300" height="400"> and can make sure Luna and 
  Nova don't get off track or take too many breaks. </p>

 <p>They are skilled at chewing, digging and have a knack for rearranging objects. They stay in shape by working out.<img src="Nova_300.jpg" alt="Nova on the rower" width="300" height="400"> <img src="luna350.jpg" alt="Luna on the rower" width="350" height="348">  </p>
 <p> Need your lawn mowed? No problem! They love to eat grass and can trim it to perfection. They are perfect diggers which is 
   ideal for planting any type of plant and with their rearanging skills they can drag the plant into place and fill the hole back
   up. </p>
 <p> When it gets too hot they like to take a break <img src="outside_300jpg.jpg" alt="Nova and Luna Taking a Break" width="300" height="400"> </p>
 <p> They are super easy going for payment. All they want are some tasty treats such as carrots, bananas,
    strawberries or kale or suprise them with something else, they even enjoy just cardboard boxes.</p>
