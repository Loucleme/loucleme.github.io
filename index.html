<h2> Meet Nova <img src="Nova2_300.jpg" alt="Nova" width="300" height="400">   <img src="lunaa.jpg" alt="Luna" width="300" height="287"> and Luna.</h2>
<p> Luna is Nova's mom and they are best friends. They are always hungry and so they are looking for work.<img src="Besties_300.jpg" alt="Nova and Luna" width="300" height="400"> </p> 
  
<p> They are restless, love to keep busy and happen to be avid gardeners. That being said, if you want to make sure they stay on task, their best friend 'Moxie', who is a cat,
  can help make sure that happens. She likes to lie down and watch tv <img src="moxiee.jpg" alt="Moxie With the Remote" width="300" height="277">. </p>
<p> However, once she is outside, she is very attentive <img src="Moxie_300.jpg" alt="Moxie Outside" width="300" height="400"> and can make sure Luna and 
  Nova don't get off track or take too many breaks. </p>
